        This is an example of a simple digest item.
        In this example it might be for a potential industry placement - for example, check out the rather nice suitcase image on the left

        These fields can use markdown so:

        1. We can use lists
        2. We can *italicize* and **bold** words
        3. We can easily write [links](http://peterhamilton.github.com)

    - list_title: Robotics Hackathon

      title: These aren't the droids you're looking for...
      body: |
        Another sample sigest item. This one is all about a fantasy hackathon!

        I imagine it would be held at Imperial and there would be more information [here](#)
        [here](#) and [here](#)

        Finally there would be the bombshell that it's **TOMORROW!**
